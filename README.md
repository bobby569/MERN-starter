# MERN Stack Dev Starter

This starter is beginner-friendly with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js for Full Stack development. Each part comes with sample code for reference. A Redux template is added for better centralizing the data in the _Redux store_. Feel free to take the advantage of it and modify the code based on individual need.
